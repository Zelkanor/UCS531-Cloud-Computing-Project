      "\n",
      "The paper describes a model that uses an encoder to map an input sequence to continuous representations and an auto-regressive decoder that generates an output sequence one element at a time, consuming previously generated symbols as input. It also details experiments involving parameter selection (e.g., dropout, learning rates, beam size) on a development set, and during inference, it uses beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty, averaging the last 20 checkpoints.\n",

      "The main conclusions are that the Transformer model outperforms previous models on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, and label smoothing improves accuracy and BLEU score despite hurting perplexity. The authors also plan to extend the Transformer to other modalities and tasks, and investigate efficient attention mechanisms for large inputs like images, audio, and video.\n",
