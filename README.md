Serverless RAG Pipeline on AWS for Document Q&A
===============================================

This project is a complete, serverless Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built on AWS. It allows a user to upload large PDF documents (like research papers) and ask questions about their content.

The system is designed to be scalable, asynchronous, and cost-effective, using AWS Lambda for compute, S3 for storage, DynamoDB as a vector-capable database, and Amazon Bedrock (with the DeepSeek model) for text generation.

Project Architecture
--------------------

The architecture is split into two main flows: the **Data Ingestion Pipeline** and the **RAG Query API**.

### 1\. Data Ingestion Pipeline (Asynchronous)

This flow is event-driven and designed to handle large, multi-page PDFs without timing out.

1.  **Client (Jupyter)**: A user requests a secure upload URL from API Gateway.
    
2.  **API Gateway (POST /upload-url)**: Triggers a Lambda to generate an S3 presigned URL.
    
3.  **Client (Jupyter)**: Uses the presigned URL to upload the PDF directly to S3.
    
4.  **S3 (PUT Event)**: The file upload triggers the process-document-batch Lambda.
    
5.  **Lambda 1 (process-document-batch)**: Starts an asynchronous start\_document\_text\_detection job with Amazon Textract. It tells Textract to send a notification to an SNS topic when complete.
    
6.  **SNS Topic (textract-job-complete)**: Receives the "Job Succeeded" message from Textract.
    
7.  **Lambda 2 (handle-textract-result)**: Is triggered by the SNS message. It fetches the full text from Textract, splits it into chunks, and batch-writes the chunks to DynamoDB with a status of PENDING.
    
8.  **EventBridge (CRON Job)**: Every 5 minutes, this triggers the generate-embeddings Lambda.
    
9.  **Lambda 3 (generate-embeddings)**: Scans DynamoDB for all chunks with PENDING or FAILED status.
    
10.  **Amazon Bedrock (Titan)**: The Lambda calls the Titan Embeddings model to get a vector for each text chunk.
    
11.  **DynamoDB**: The Lambda updates the items with their vector embedding and sets the status to COMPLETED.
    

### 2\. RAG Query API (Synchronous)

This flow is a standard API that allows a user to ask a question and get a single, synthesized answer.

1.  **Client (Jupyter)**: Sends a JSON request ({"question": "..."}) to the /query endpoint.
    
2.  **API Gateway (POST /query)**: Triggers the handle-query Lambda.
    
3.  **Lambda 4 (handle-query)**:a. Generates an embedding for the user's _question_ (using the same Titan model).b. Scans DynamoDB for all COMPLETED chunks.c. Calculates the cosine similarity between the question's vector and every chunk's vector.d. Returns the top\_k (e.g., top 5) most similar chunks.
    
4.  **Client (Jupyter)**: Receives the top chunks and immediately calls the /answer endpoint, passing the question and the chunks.
    
5.  **API Gateway (POST /answer)**: Triggers the generate-answer Lambda.
    
6.  **Lambda 5 (generate-answer)**:a. Builds a new prompt containing the user's question and the "context" from the retrieved chunks.b. Calls **Amazon Bedrock (DeepSeek)** with this augmented prompt.
    
7.  **Client (Jupyter)**: Receives the final, LLM-generated answer and the source chunks used to create it.
